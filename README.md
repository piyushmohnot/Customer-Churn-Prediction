# Customer-Churn-Prediction
 
## Objective
To understand churn signals for the marketing customers, predict when and why a customer is going to churn, and improve retention so that the marketing team can take action to reach out to such customers before they churn and prevent them in churning.

## Business Case
Churn Predictions can be used in Marketing Campaigns. If a company knows that a certain percentage of its customer base is likely to churn, it may make sense to reach out to them with a marketing campaign ahead of time.
